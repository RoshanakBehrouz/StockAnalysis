# 📑 Final Test Summary for StockAnalysis Project

## 🧪 Overall Testing Strategy

- **Framework**: JUnit5 with Mockito for mocking dependencies.
- **Test Types**:
  - Unit Tests: For individual classes and methods.
  - Integration Tests: For verifying end-to-end behavior between modules.
- **Tagging**: `@Tag("unit")` and `@Tag("integration")` used to classify tests.

## 📋 Modules and Test Coverage

### 1. Controller Layer
- **StockControllerTest**: ✅
  - Unit tested saving, prediction, chart viewing.
  - Verified ViewListener notification.
  - Strong assertions on actual behaviors.
  - Integration tests included real model behavior.

### 2. Model Layer
- **LinearRegressionModelTest**: ✅
- **PolynomialRegressionModelTest**: ✅
- **MultivariatePolynomialRegressionModelTest**: ✅
- **MultiFeatureLinearRegressionModelTest**: ✅
- **LassoRegressionModelTest**: ✅
- **RidgeRegressionModelTest**: ✅
  - Tests ensure models handle normal, empty, and invalid input.
  - Tests validate correct exception throwing where applicable.

### 3. Service Layer
- **StockDataFetcherTest**: ✅
  - Integration tests validate real API interaction and data parsing.
- **ModelManagerTest**: ✅
  - Strong mocks to validate model registration and selection.

### 4. Utility Layer
- **ConfigLoaderTest**: ✅
  - Mocked properties handling.
- **CSVUtilsTest**: ✅
  - Temp file usage for filesystem interaction tests.

### 5. View Layer
- **ChartHandlerTest**: ✅
  - Basic validation that rendering logic does not crash.

## ⚠️ Observed Log Warnings During Test Runs

During model-related tests, especially when using mocks or empty datasets, the following logs were observed:
```
SEVERE: Warning: Model null does not support any mode!
SEVERE: Insufficient data for model evaluation.
```
### 📌 Defense for These Warnings:
- These warnings arise **intentionally** when mocked models are **null** or **data is insufficient**.
- In real application runtime, proper models are always selected and trained dynamically before prediction or evaluation.
- These logs **do not affect the correctness of the tests** because the **assertions focus on behavior** rather than logs.
- The warnings are useful to **validate defensive coding** inside `ModelManager` to handle bad input scenarios gracefully.

## ✅ Conclusion

- ✔️ All tests **pass** with correct assertions.
- ✔️ Code behaves predictably even in corner cases.
- ✔️ Logging warnings were expected and **do not indicate failures**.

**Test Quality:  High**  
**Test Coverage: Broad across controllers, services, models, and utilities.**
